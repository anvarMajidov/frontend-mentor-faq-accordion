## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

CSS:

1. To make images responsive specify their width in percentage.
2. To make image's place responsive, sometimes you need make its parent relative,
   and set position:absolute to image itself, and control its place by changing
   transform:translate3d(x%,y%,0)
3. Second advice does not work, if you want to fill the parent element with
   image child element.

JS:

1. scrollHeight - is used to get the height of an element depending on screen size

### Continued development

Work more with javascript animations. Current performance of this website is not bad but still it is not perfect. Because it is bad practice to animate max-height property
